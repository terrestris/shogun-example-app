# SHOGun Example App

This example project demonstrates on how to create a custom application implementation based
on [SHOGun](https://github.com/terrestris/shogun).

## Development

Please refer to the section [Custom project development](https://github.com/terrestris/shogun-docker/blob/main/README.md#custom-project-development)
in the [shogun-docker](https://github.com/terrestris/shogun-docker) repository for a more
detailed and recommended way this application can be used as a starter.

Otherwise the [same requirements](https://github.com/terrestris/shogun#development) as in SHOGun development must be considered here.
